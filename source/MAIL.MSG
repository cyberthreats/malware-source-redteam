Hiya!

Just thought I'd warn you about a destructive new e-mail virus. 
Here is some info:

> The "Red Team" virus is a complex new computer virus that spreads via 
> the Microsoft Windows operating system, and Internet E-Mail. Although 
> it is not the first virus to spread via E-Mail (that was "Good Times"), 
> the Red Team virus is unparalelled in its destructive capabilities. 
> Further more, the virus is exceedingly common - it has already been 
> reported in much of western Europe, the USA, Russia, Australia, and 
> Japan. In short, everywhere.
>
> We at QUEST, have spent several weeks analysing this virus, and are proud 
> to anounce that we finally have a cure! The program, named "K-RTEAM" 
> (Kill Red Team), can be executed in any Microsoft Windows environment, and 
> will reliably detect (and remove if nescessary) the Red Team virus from 
> your system buffers.

The reason I thought I should warn you, is that we recently had a run in 
with this beast.  Luckily we managed to get a copy of the excellent 
'K-RTEAM' programme before the destruction really started. Just in case
you should suffer the same misfortune, I have included this programme for
you too.

Bye!

P.S. Make sure you warn all your friends of this new threat!
